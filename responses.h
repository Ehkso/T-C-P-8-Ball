/* All possible responses from the Magic 8 Ball.
 * You might notice that the responses are positive:unclear:negative
 * in a 2:1:1 ratio. However, I find that forms of divination work best
 * when you focus less on the math or science behind it, and focus
 * more on having faith in, well, fate. Though, if you're here reading
 * the header file of a random bored kid's 8 ball, some people might
 * assume you don't care much for magick. Anyway, moral of the story is don't sweat it :) */
