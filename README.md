# T-C-P-8-Ball
A little 8-ball in C that uses TCP sockets to communicate between the client (the user) and the server (the Ball).

I made this because I was bored, mostly. That boredom turned to frustration because after I finished it I accidentally
deleted it all and couldn't get it back, so I had to recode it quickly. The comments in the code explain the stuff;
it's an 8-ball, most people know how to use one.

## Usage:
1. Download the .c and .h files.
2. Compile iserver.c and iclient.c and run them both at the same time (ie on two separate terminals).
3. Enjoy :)

I included the .exe's as well as the C files, just in case you don't want to compile it yourself.
